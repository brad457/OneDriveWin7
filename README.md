# OneDriveWin7
This repo contains a version of Microsoft's OneDrive that successfully installs on Windows 7 / 8.  All other versions I tried gave the error: OneDrive Couldn't Be Installed 0x80040c97

# OneDriveSetupWin7.exe
Because the maximum file size for GitHub is 25 MB and the OneDriveSetupWin7.exe is 33.3 MB I had to split the zip file into two parts.

Download Part 1: <a href="https://github.com/brad457/OneDriveWin7/blob/main/OneDriveSetupWin7.zip.001"> OneDriveSetupWin7.zip.001 </a> 
Download Part 2: <a href="https://github.com/brad457/OneDriveWin7/blob/main/OneDriveSetupWin7.zip.002"> OneDriveSetupWin7.zip.002 </a>

I tried using various types of file encryption methods to get the file size under 25 MB with no luck (closest I came was 29.9 MB).
